<p>
    This page shows a hierarchy containing the <span th:text="${inventoryObjectType}"></span> with ID
    <span th:text="${inventoryObjectId}"></span>, that you selected.
    In the tree shown below, an arrow points to the <span th:text="${inventoryObjectType}"></span> you selected.
</p>

<p>
    If you selected a device, and that device belongs to a composite device, then all the devices in that composite will
    be shown
    (a device sometimes have other devices as children and may have a single device as its parent).<br>
    If the device has been placed in a location, then that location (and potentially that location's parent, etc.) will
    be shown.<br>
    All alarms associated with the devices will also be shown (prefixed by a *).
</p>

<p>
    If you selected a location, then that location's parent location (and so on), will also be shown.<br>
</p>

<p>
    As the root of the tree, the organization will be shown.
